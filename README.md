# README

#todo to finish this:
-clean up formatting (user details show page, titles, colors)
-get the app running on heroku

- found a bug in the lesson code - both following 10 and this stock  views/stocks/_list.html /_result.html
(fixed in two places added second condition to if statement before 'this stock')

-post to udemy for lesson 286

possible enhancement
-add search to see what friends follow what stocks
-add comments to portfolio
--one way would be to change the users stocks table
    not sure if that would be the right way
-clean up formatting of prices




This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Using devise gem to manage users/sessions
Using bootstrap for styling

Using IEX api for prices

- gem for sqlite must be moved to dev/test
- gem for postgres added to production
- bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linus command

[ need to figure out how to edit encrypted files on Heroku ]
